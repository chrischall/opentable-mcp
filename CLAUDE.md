# CLAUDE.md — opentable-mcp

Guidance for Claude working in this repo.

## TL;DR

v0.9.0: OpenTable MCP server with 13 tools (read + write), fronted by a
pluggable browser bridge. Default transport: localhost WebSocket to a
companion Chrome extension under `./extension/`. Opt-in alternative:
`OT_BRIDGE=mcp-chrome` routes through hangwin/mcp-chrome's HTTP MCP
endpoint instead (no embedded extension; uses theirs). Either way,
Akamai sees a real browser fetch — never us directly.

## Bridge selection

`OT_BRIDGE` env var picks the transport:

- `OT_BRIDGE=websocket` (default) — embedded extension under `./extension/`,
  WebSocket on 127.0.0.1:37149 (override with `OT_WS_PORT`). What every
  release through v0.8.0 used; the only path with full live verification.
- `OT_BRIDGE=mcp-chrome` — talks to hangwin/mcp-chrome at
  `http://127.0.0.1:12306/mcp` (override with `OT_MCP_CHROME_URL`).
  Requires mcp-chrome ≥ the release containing
  [PR #348](https://github.com/hangwin/mcp-chrome/pull/348) — the
  `tabUrl` parameter on `chrome_network_request`. Pre-PR mcp-chrome
  versions are active-tab-only and break credentialed cross-origin
  fetches. Live-verification of this path is pending the upstream merge.

## Commands

- `npm test` — vitest, all mocked, no network. Must stay green.
- `npm run build` — `tsc --noEmit` typecheck + esbuild bundle → `dist/bundle.js`.
- `npx tsc --noEmit` — typecheck only (also runs as part of `npm run build`).
- `node dist/bundle.js` — launch the MCP server over stdio (also starts the WS listener).
- `npx tsx scripts/probe-find-slots.ts` — live GET round-trip via the extension.
- `npx tsx scripts/probe-favorites-toggle.ts` — live add + remove favorite.
- `npx tsx scripts/probe-book-cancel.ts` — **books and immediately cancels a real reservation.** Pick a restaurant that won't mind a 3-second booking.
- `npx tsx scripts/probe-book-cc-cancel.ts` — same as above but for a CC-required slot (exercises the preview → book flow).
- `npx tsx scripts/probe-book-cancel-uk.ts` — UK-region variant (databaseRegion, country handling).
- `npx tsx scripts/probe-find-slots-raw.ts` — dumps the raw GraphQL availability response (useful when re-capturing persisted-query hashes).
- `npx tsx scripts/probe-list-res.ts` — dump upcoming reservations; useful after a probe to check for dangling ones.
- `npx tsx scripts/serve-only.ts` — raw WS listener that logs every extension frame. Debugging only.
- `npx tsx scripts/e2e-phase-a.ts` — read-only smoke (list reservations / profile / favorites).

All `probe-*.ts` / `e2e-*.ts` scripts require the extension loaded at `chrome://extensions` and a signed-in opentable tab.

```

- **`src/transport.ts`** — the `OpenTableTransport` interface (`start/close/fetch`) and shared `FetchInit`/`FetchResult` types. Two implementations:
  - **`src/ws-server.ts`** — `OpenTableWsServer`: 127.0.0.1:37149 listener. Default. Accepts one extension, routes `fetch` RPCs, 20s ping, 15s connect timeout, 30s request timeout.
  - **`src/transport-mcp-chrome.ts`** — `McpChromeTransport`: opt-in via `OT_BRIDGE=mcp-chrome`. Talks to hangwin/mcp-chrome's HTTP MCP at `127.0.0.1:12306/mcp`. Each fetch maps to a `chrome_network_request` call pinned to `tabUrl: "https://www.opentable.com/"`. Requires the `tabUrl` param landing upstream — see https://github.com/hangwin/mcp-chrome/pull/348.
- **`src/client.ts`** — `OpenTableClient`: thin facade over `OpenTableTransport`. `fetchHtml(path)` for GETs that return HTML, `fetchJson(path, init)` for JSON POSTs/DELETEs. Maps non-2xx, empty-body (204), and sign-in-page responses into typed errors. Transport-agnostic.
- **`src/tools/*.ts`** — one file per concern (reservations, restaurants, favorites, search, user). Each exports `registerXxxTools(server, client)`. See "Tool surface" below.
- **`src/parse-*.ts`** — pure HTML/JSON parsers. Fully unit-tested.
- **`src/initial-state.ts`** — extracts `window.__INITIAL_STATE__` from SSR HTML pages.
- **`src/booking-token.ts`** — encodes/decodes the opaque, stateless base64-JSON `booking_token` that bridges `opentable_book_preview` → `opentable_book` with a tamper check.
- **`extension/`** — MV3 companion extension:
  - `manifest.json` — MV3, two `content_scripts` entries (isolated + MAIN world), `scripting` permission for self-heal.
  - `background.js` — service worker, owns the WS, routes fetches to the tab via `chrome.tabs.sendMessage`, self-heals dead content scripts via `chrome.scripting.executeScript`.
  - `content.js` — isolated-world fetch relay. Adds CSRF from `document.documentElement.dataset.otMcpCsrf`, calls `fetch(url, { credentials: 'include' })`, returns `{ok, status, body, url}`.
  - `capture-logger.js` — MAIN-world XHR/fetch logger. Populates `window.__otMcpCaptures` for endpoint discovery, syncs `window.__CSRF_TOKEN__` to the DOM dataset so the isolated content script can read it.
  - `popup.html` / `popup.js` — three-dot status (WS / tab / auth) + Reconnect + Open OpenTable buttons.
- **`tests/`** — 1:1 mirror of `src/`. `tests/helpers.ts` provides an in-memory MCP harness (stdio transports on a PassThrough pair) for tool tests.

## Tool surface

| Tool | File | Endpoint(s) | Kind |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `opentable_list_reservations` | `tools/reservations.ts` | GET `/user/dining-dashboard` SSR | read |
| `opentable_get_profile` | `tools/user.ts` | GET `/user/dining-dashboard` SSR | read |
| `opentable_list_favorites` | `tools/favorites.ts` | GET `/user/favorites` SSR | read |
| `opentable_search_restaurants` | `tools/search.ts` | POST `/dapi/fe/gql?opname=Autocomplete` | read |
| `opentable_get_restaurant` | `tools/restaurants.ts` | GET `/r/{slug}` SSR | read |
| `opentable_find_slots` | `tools/reservations.ts` | POST `/dapi/fe/gql?opname=RestaurantsAvailability` | read |
| `opentable_book_preview` | `tools/reservations.ts` | GET `/booking/details` SSR + POST `BookDetailsStandardSlotLock` | read |
| `opentable_book` | `tools/reservations.ts` | (token path) POST `/dapi/booking/make-reservation`; (no-token path) GET `/booking/details` SSR + POST `BookDetailsStandardSlotLock` → POST `/dapi/booking/make-reservation` | write |
| `opentable_cancel` | `tools/reservations.ts` | POST `/dapi/fe/gql?opname=CancelReservation` | write |
| `opentable_add_favorite` | `tools/favorites.ts` | POST `/dapi/wishlist/add` | write |
| `opentable_remove_favorite` | `tools/favorites.ts` | POST `/dapi/wishlist/remove` | write |

Note: `manifest.json` now lists all 13 tools (was historically out of sync — `opentable_book_preview` was missing). The release workflow rewrites versions but not the tool list — if you change the tool surface, update `manifest.json` by hand.

## Environment

No environment variables required. Auth lives in the user's browser via the companion extension. `.env.example` is kept as a marker only.

## Conventions

- All tools are `opentable_*`-prefixed.
- Tool return shape: `{ content: [{ type: 'text', text: JSON.stringify(..., null, 2) }] }`.
- Readonly tools set `annotations: { readOnlyHint: true }`.
- Prefer JSON bodies. The write tools hit OpenTable's internal JSON/GraphQL endpoints; don't use `URLSearchParams` unless an endpoint explicitly requires form-encoding.
- Write a failing test before implementation (TDD). Tool tests live in `tests/tools/<name>.test.ts` and mock `OpenTableClient.fetchJson` / `fetchHtml`.
- Prefer Apollo persisted queries (just the `sha256Hash`, no GraphQL body). Hashes are pinned at the top of the tool file — if OpenTable re-deploys, the server returns `PersistedQueryNotFound` and the hashes need re-capture. Fastest re-capture path: on the page where the op fires (e.g. `/booking/details` for slot-lock ops), once the mutation has run, read `window.__APOLLO_CLIENT__.queryManager.mutationStore['1'].mutation.documentId` from DevTools — Apollo's `documentId` IS the persisted-query sha256Hash. For queries, iterate `queryManager.queries.forEach((q) => q.document.documentId)`. Beats the XHR-logger approach because the cookie/CSRF stays in the page and there's nothing to copy out of a request body.

## Testing

Tests live in `tests/`, a 1:1 mirror of `src/`. Run with `npm test` (vitest). All fetches are mocked — no real network. `vitest.config.ts` enables v8 coverage reporting (`npm run test:coverage`) but does not enforce thresholds.

## Versioning

Version appears in SIX places — all must match:

1. `package.json` → `"version"`
2. `package-lock.json` → kept in sync by `npm version` / `npm install --package-lock-only`
3. `src/index.ts` → `McpServer` constructor `version` field (and the startup `console.error` banner)
4. `manifest.json` → `"version"`
5. `server.json` → `"version"` and `packages[].version`
6. `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` → `"version"` AND `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` → `metadata.version` + `plugins[].version`

### Important

Do NOT manually bump versions or create tags unless the user explicitly asks. Versioning is handled by the **Tag & Bump** GitHub Action (`.github/workflows/tag-and-bump.yml`).

### Release workflow

Main is always one version ahead of the latest tag. To release, run the **Tag & Bump** GitHub Action which:

1. Runs CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`: build + test)
2. Tags the current commit with the current version
3. Bumps patch via `npm version patch` and `sed`s `src/index.ts` + rewrites `manifest.json`
4. Rebuilds, commits, and pushes main + tag
5. The tag push triggers `.github/workflows/release.yml` (CI + `.mcpb` pack + `.skill` zip + npm publish + MCP registry + ClawHub + GitHub release with auto-generated notes)

`release.yml` also normalises `server.json`, `manifest.json`, `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, and `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` to the tag version on every release — so a stale version in those files at build time is recoverable; a stale version in `src/index.ts` (the banner) is not.

## Hot spots / gotchas

- **`/r/<numeric-id>` 404s.** OpenTable's restaurant URLs use slugs (`/r/state-of-confusion-charlotte`), not numeric IDs. `opentable_book` therefore requires `dining_area_id` as an explicit arg — call `opentable_get_restaurant` with a slug first to read `diningAreas[]`.
- **Content scripts don't survive extension reload.** Existing opentable tabs lose `content.js` + `capture-logger.js` when the extension reloads. The background SW re-injects them automatically (onInstalled/onStartup + fallback on `sendMessage` failure). If a user hits "Could not establish connection" errors, reloading the extension once should fix it permanently.
- **MV3 service worker sleeps.** Idle SWs get killed after ~30s. We hold a 20s ping to the server and a 25s `chrome.alarms` tick. Cold wake can delay the first request by up to ~5s.
- **CSRF tokens live on `window.__CSRF_TOKEN__`** (MAIN world) but `content.js` runs in an isolated world. `capture-logger.js` syncs the token to `document.documentElement.dataset.otMcpCsrf` every 2s so `content.js` can include it in headers for write endpoints.
- **Persisted-query cache lag on `/user/favorites`.** After `add_favorite` returns 204, the SSR dashboard may not reflect the new entry for ~10s. Document this in the tool description, don't fight the cache.
- **Sign-in detection.** `OpenTableClient.throwIfSignInPage` checks for `/authenticate/` in the response URL or sign-in markers in a short response body. When it throws, the user must sign into opentable.com in the bridged Chrome tab.
- **CC-required slots route through preview.** The slot-lock response doesn't carry the CC-required flag or cancellation policy — those live in the `/booking/details` SSR page's `__INITIAL_STATE__` (`timeSlot.creditCardRequired`, `messages.cancellationPolicyMessage`, `wallet.savedCards`). `opentable_book_preview` fetches that page + slot-locks, and mints a `booking_token` that `opentable_book` consumes. `booking_token` is opaque, stateless base64-JSON — no server-side cache — with a tamper check (restaurant/date/time/party/dining-area must match the caller's own args). OpenTable's ~90s slot-lock TTL is the only expiry; a stale token surfaces as `SLOT_LOCK_EXPIRED` which `opentable_book` maps to an actionable error.
- **Same-day conflicts.** OpenTable refuses two reservations on the same date. Both `opentable_book` and `opentable_book_preview` parse `/booking/details` for overlapping reservations and fail early with a human-readable error rather than letting `/dapi/booking/make-reservation` return an opaque 409.
- **3-D Secure (SCA).** If a card's issuer demands a 3DS challenge on book, we can't complete it from outside the browser. `opentable_book` surfaces `partnerScaRedirectUrl` and bails — rare for pre-authenticated saved cards.
- **Experience-mandatory slots use a separate slot-lock op.**
  `BookDetailsExperienceSlotLock` (persisted-query hash captured
  2026-05-20 against Pasqual's) replaces `BookDetailsStandardSlotLock`
  when `slot.type === "Experience"`. The `/booking/details` URL also
  picks up `experienceIds`, `selectedExperience`, `tableCategory`,
  `st=Experience`, and `isMandatory=true` query params, which let us
  skip the `seating-options` and `specials` intermediate pages the
  browser UI walks through. If OpenTable redeploys and invalidates the
  Experience hash, run `scripts/probe-experience-slot-lock-hash.ts`
  against Pasqual's to re-capture.
- **Listing-only restaurants can't be booked through OpenTable.**
  `restaurant.type === "Listing"` (Le Bernardin's classification, e.g.)
  surfaces as `bookable: false` on `opentable_get_restaurant`. There's
  no slot picker; agents should surface the restaurant's phone + URL
  rather than call `opentable_book`.
- **Modify uses the same SSR + slot-lock as book, with three URL markers.** `/booking/details?confirmationNumber=<n>&securityToken=<t>&isModify=true&…<new-slot-params>` returns the modify state. The `make-reservation` body for the modify path keys off `confnumber` (lowercase, no underscore — OpenTable's quirky shorthand) + `securityToken`; `reservationId` is NOT allowed in the modify body even though the SSR state's `modifyReservation.gpid` looks like it should be the identifier. The same-day-conflict helper takes an `excludeConfirmation` arg — `opentable_modify_preview` uses it to avoid false-positives against the reservation being moved.

## Live probing workflow

1. `npm run build` — keep `dist/bundle.js` fresh.
2. `lsof -ti :37149 | xargs -r kill` — clear any orphan MCP server from a prior crashed probe.
3. `npx tsx scripts/probe-<x>.ts` — the probe spawns its own `dist/bundle.js` over stdio. The extension reconnects within ~2s (tight 200-5000ms backoff) and announces `ready` once it finds an opentable tab.
4. If the first call fails with "extension offline", the extension is probably sleeping — reopen the popup or reload the extension once.

## What to *not* do

- Don't add new transport-layer hacks (cycletls, impersonate-curl, Playwright). v0.2 tried those; Akamai wins. The extension bridge is the whole design.
- Don't paste cookies or env-configure auth. Auth lives in the user's browser now.
- Don't register tools that can't be tested against a mock `OpenTableClient`. All tool logic should be behind `fetchJson` / `fetchHtml` so tests can drive it without a real WS.
- Don't bump the persisted-query hashes speculatively. Only re-capture when a live request fails with `PersistedQueryNotFound`.

## Pull requests & release notes

**Default workflow: branch + PR, even for solo work.** Direct pushes to `main` skip review *and* skip auto-generated release notes — GitHub's `generate_release_notes` (configured in `.github/release.yml`) only picks up merged PRs. Push directly to `main` only when the user explicitly asks for it (e.g. emergency hotfix).

For every PR, apply exactly one label so it lands in the right release-notes section:

| Label                | Section in release notes |
|----------------------|--------------------------|
| `enhancement`        | Features                 |
| `bug`                | Bug Fixes                |
| `security`           | Security                 |
| `refactor`           | Refactor                 |
| `documentation`      | Documentation            |
| `test`               | Tests                    |
| `dependencies`       | Dependencies             |
| `ci` / `github_actions` | CI & Build            |
| *(none / unmatched)* | Other Changes            |
| `ignore-for-release` | Hidden from notes        |

The **PR title** becomes the bullet — write it like a user-facing changelog entry (`opentable_book_preview: refuse stale booking tokens`), not internal shorthand (`book tweaks`). Conventional-commit prefixes (`feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`) are still fine in commit messages, but the PR title should read clean.

Open with `gh pr create --label <label>` (or `--label ignore-for-release` for chores not worth a line), then **immediately** run `gh pr merge <num> --auto --merge` so the PR merges as soon as CI passes. The repo allows merge commits only (no squash, no rebase) — don't pass `--squash`/`--rebase` or the call will fail.
